Given the following grammar
$$
S\to(L)|a
$$
$$
L\to L,S|S
$$
- Eliminate left recursions in the grammar.
- Draw the transition diagrams for the grammar
- Write a recursive descent predictive parser.
- Indicate the procedure call sequence for an input sentence $(a,(a,a))$.



# Exercise 4.2
Consider the context-free grammar
$$
S\to aSbS|bSaS|\varepsilon
$$
Can you construct a predictive parser for the grammar? and why?


# Exercise 4.3
